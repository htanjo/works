    description: `<p>
        A work-in-progress exploration game inspired by "The Exit 8."
        Players aim to uncover strange phenomena and escape a mysterious mansion.
        This 3D experience runs directly in web browsers and features simple up-and-down scrolling as the primary interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        A technical demo is currently available, accessible from both PCs and mobile devices.
        The game is optimized for various environments, ensuring smooth rendering on any platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built entirely from scratch with minimal use of pre-existing assets, this project includes modeling, material creation, and programming.
        By combining PBR (Physically Based Rendering) with lightmap baking, it achieves visuals approaching the quality seen on PS5, taking full advantage of its diorama-like design.

    description: `<p>
        A Flash-based 3D racing game designed to run in web browsers.
        This was also my university graduation project.
        It featured time attack modes, car customization, and a replay system.
        Even the car physics were programmed from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time, technical limitations made it difficult to render entire circuits in real-time.
        To overcome this, I employed techniques like layered composition for pseudo-LOD and partial 2D rendering, enabling the recreation of expansive tracks.

    description: `<p>
        A graphics enhancement mod for the PC game "Cyberpunk 2077."
        By replacing the in-game LUTs (color lookup tables), it reduces overexposure and improves color accuracy beyond the original visuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the changes may seem subtle in screenshots, the difference becomes striking during gameplay.
        Preserving the essence of the original aesthetics, the mod enhances color depth and vibrancy, earning high praise from the modding community on Nexus Mods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon release, it ranked #1 on Hot Mods and, as of January 2025—eight months post-launch—it has achieved 15,000 downloads.

        A graphics mod for the PC game "The Witcher 3" that adjusts the color palette of the Toussaint region.
        It transforms the region's slightly surreal, painterly landscapes into more natural tones.
        The mod rewrites weather settings, toning down cyan hues in the skies and distant views.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, due to compatibility issues introduced by the game's latest patch, this mod was never publicly released.

        In my home, the appliances use different control methods—infrared, HTTP, and ZigBee—which require separate apps for each type of smart device.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this, I centralized control of the different protocols using a Node-RED backend, while the frontend was built as a single app with React Native.
        It was then installed on family members' smartphones.

      <p>
        The model features a variety of techniques, including strong shading, wood grain, metallic finishes, peeling paint and markings, rain streaks, mud stains, and rust.
        The face of the soldier figure is as small as a matchstick head, yet I carefully painted the eyes, nose, and mouth using a fine detail brush.
